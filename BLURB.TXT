Dear XXX

Here is how to turn picker into a registered piece of software.

0) Dont delete this mail, it contains important registration information
	that will not be stored in a human readable format on your computer.

1) start picker, keep this email visible as you will find it easier to
	paste the details into picker rather than type the details in

2) Press the About button If the version number is less than version
	2.2.0 you need to download the latest version of picker from my website			
					http://www.paglis.co.uk/picker/



**************************************************************************
* THE REGISTRATION DETAILS BELOW ARE ONLY VALID FOR PICKER32 VERSION 2.1.6
**************************************************************************

3) Enter your username 
	XXX

4a) Paste the following text into the password box
	XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

4b) you should be able to use the same registration code in the
	analysis program, which allows you to keep track of the numbers in
	your lottery system.


5) Press the register button. The picker will give you a brief message
	thanking your for registering.

That's it. Picker is now registered. This means that 


a) picker won't ever whinge about not being registered

b) You get added to my mailing list so that I can tell you when to go to
	my website http://www.paglis.co.uk/ to pick up new versions of
	picker. I dont give out details of anyone on my mailing list to anyone
	else so you wont get any junk mail from any other organisations

c) by registering you have entitled yourself to a discount of the next
	version of picker. Picker is part of the growing picker suite which at
	the moment consists of the picker itself and the analysis program. I am
	currently in the process of adding a wheeling program and a prediction
	program. These will be free to registered users.

d) You get an electronic copy of my up and coming sci fi novel for free
	if and when it gets published.

e) If you have any feature requests I will try to implement them in as
	short a time as possible.

I've recently added the neat ability to customise picker into different
languages, theres a new utility called lanfg_edit that allows you to
customise picker into almost any language you like.

Also in the options you can choose to use backdrop images. Picker will
look for images on your hard drive in directories below where you
installed picker and periodically load them into the background - behind
the balls - like a peepshow.

Also there is better online help to picker.

you can download the latest version from my website
http://www.paglis.co.uk/picker

At the moment I'm adding performance, printing and prediction facilities
to picker. I'll let you know when these are ready to download. 

Thanks Again for registering, you've given me that extra determination
to keep coding into the early hours of the night.

Ps. dont delete this mail, the registration information is not stored in
a way that you can read it on your machine. If you reinstall windows or
change machine, you'll need this information again. 

PPS. if you have made any suggestions, thankyou. however as a one man
band, I'd like to but cant give any guarantees that  your  suggestions
will make it into future versions of picker. the suggestions mechanism
is a sort of Ideaware, people pay  for picker by sharing ideas, but some
surprisingly and happily insist on paying money.
