			The global lottery phenomenon has shown without doubt that people are
			incapable of picking random numbers as well as a computer.
			<p>
			Picker is	program that uses the sort of mechanical logic used in a
			real lottery machine to pick numbers. Just like a real lottery
			machine, picker does not attempt to predict but simply bounces balls
			about until one hits the open trapdoor and gets selected. Unlike
			other programs that magic up a set of numbers, with picker you get to
			see the balls flying about.
			<p>
			With the picker you can select the balls you want in play and how
			many of them you want the picker to pick. These settings are
			preserved for each session. Picker now allows you to set the release
			angle for the balls.
			<p>
			A separate analysis module is provided for registered users. This
			allows you to identify trends in balls drawn to date and use them to
			influence the choice of balls you want in play. I plan to do a lot
			more on the analysis module.
			<p>
			Although supplied as two executables, registering one program
			automatically registers the other. The registration fee is 5 US
			Dollars. Thats a massive price reduction of 75%.
			<p>
		</font></td>
		<td width=50% valign=top><font face=arial size=2>
			You can however get a free registration code. To do that simply email
			me a suggestion on how I might improve picker, and as long as you are
			the first to suggest it I'll send you a registration code in return.
			<p>
			The program will start to remind you to register 30 days after it is
			first used. Registration details are provided within the programs by
			pressing the "about" button. 
			<p>
			A secure online ordering facility set up through Kagi shareware
			processing now allows you to puchase picker with any major
			credit card. Press the "Buy" button in the "about" window to be
			guided through the process. Shortly after your order has been
			processed by my payment agents kagi you should receive an
			unlock code from me (there may be a delay of upto 2weeks before
			you receive your unlock code).

	<table border=0 width=100% cellpadding=5><tr>
		<td width=50% valign=top>
		<p><font face=arial size=2> Most lottery programs I've tried are too clinical, 
		  most are for the hardened lottery player. I wanted to write something 
		  that challenged my programming skills, something that picked numbers in 
		  the same way as a real lottery machine. </font></p>
		<p><font face=arial size=2>Picker and the analysis module are just the first 
		  two parts of the </font><font face=arial size=2>picker lottery suite. 
		  In the near future I hope to be developing a number of other really cool 
		  programs on the lottery theme. </font></p>
		</td>
		
	 <td width=50% valign=top> 
		<p><font face=arial size=2>Also you may ask why price it at only 5 US dollars, 
		  how is it ever going to make me any money?</font></p>
		<p><font face="arial" size="2">The simple answer is that it wont at that 
		  price unless I sell a heck of a lot of registrations. Frankly it doesnt 
		  bother me. I've allready more than recouped the cost of Delphi, the only 
		  cost that went into making picker, except my time. For me, this is a hobby, 
		  I actually have a good job with a major IT consultancy and have the sort 
		  of skills that will always be in demand. </font></p>
		<p><font face="arial" size="2">Producing programs like picker are a way 
		  of challenging myself and testing out ideas. The money isn't that important 
		  otherwise why would I offer to give picker away for free to anyone who 
		  gives me an idea.</font></p>

	<a name=post_register><h3>The Benefits</h3></a>
	<table border=0 width=100% cellpadding=5><tr>
		<td width=50% valign=top><font face=arial size=2>
			When you register, you will off course receive my undying gratitude.
			You will have helped a poor-<i>ish</i> man become very happy.
			<p>
			But that's not all. You also have joined a community of people who have
			generously contributed their ideas to create a program that they all want.
			<p>
			I do my best to notify you of significant updates to the picker suite.
			
		<p> An <a href=analysis/drawn.htm>Analysis program</a> that will help identify 
		  trends from previous draws. You can use this information to help pick 
		  better numbers. 
		<p>
		</font></td>
		<td width=50% valign=top><font face=arial size=2>
			Other benefits that are yet to come
			<p>
			A fun prediction utility that will use statistics and neural 
			networks and other fancy computer geekery to try and predict the 
			apparently unpredictable
			<p>
			And a wheeling program that will present wheels like you've never 
			seen before.
			<p>
			A discount on the electronic copy of my forthcoming 
			<nobr><a href=novel.htm>science fiction novel</a></nobr>
			<p>
			What more could you possibly ask for?
