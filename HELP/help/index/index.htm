<h1>Picker Suite</h1>
<p><font size="2">Welcome, you've found the right program to pick your lottery 
  numbers if that is you're like me in that it takes ages to pick your numbers. 
  This little program removes the need to tie yourself up in mental knots trying 
  to decide whether number 25 might turn up this week, because it didnt turn up 
  last week. or whether 36 and 23 are more likely to turn up instead of 5 and 
  37. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">You see this program thinks like the sort of machine that picks 
  the numbers in the real lottery/lotto draws. In Scientific terms, it throws 
  some balls together, stirrs them around and then pops them out. Thats technical 
  enough. If you want more details tough my advice is to go and get a life. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Lets get something straight, I dont know whether this program 
  is going to increase your chances of getting very rich. I do know that if you've 
  registered this program, I've just made a few bucks. And I deserve it, this 
  little program took months of coding and testing .. actually I should be charging 
  a lot more and you've got a very good deal. Anyway back to the point - The point 
  of the program is to allow you to pick some numbers that a real lottery machine 
  might just pick - which I figure increases your chances as you dont get to waste 
  your money by choosing stupid numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,6 which you know are never 
  ever going to turn up.</font></p>

        Quite a few poeple have allready done this and they get a free program 
        that does what they want. I don't really care too much about not getting 
        the cash, this is just a hobby (<i>for the moment</i>).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please note that by 
        sending a suggestion, you are giving me the non-exclusive right to freely 
        use the suggestion in a manner of my choosing. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What I do get out 
        of your suggestions is the satisfaction that people are contributing to 
        the success of my programs. Not just freeloading. </font> </p>
